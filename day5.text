✅ 1. Virtual Function (Runtime Polymorphism in Python)
🔹 C++: Uses virtual keyword
🔹 Python: All methods are virtual by default
🔸 Python Code:
class Base:
    def print(self):
        print("print base class")
    
    def show(self):
        print("show base class")

class Derived(Base):
    def print(self):
        print("print derived class")

    def show(self):
        print("show derived class")

# Runtime Polymorphism
obj = Derived()
base_ref = obj  # Base reference to Derived object

base_ref.print()  # Calls Derived's print()
base_ref.show()   # Calls Base's show()

🗣️ Interview Answer:
In Python, we don't use a virtual keyword. All methods are virtual by default.
This means if a base class reference points to a derived object, the derived class method will run if it’s overridden. This gives us runtime polymorphism, just like virtual functions in C++.



✅ 2. Pure Virtual Function & Abstract Classes
🔹 C++: virtual void func() = 0;
🔹 Python: Use abc module and @abstractmethod
🔸 Python Code:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Base(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def show(self):
        pass  # No implementation (pure virtual)

class Derived(Base):
    def show(self):
        print("You can see me!")

# Main
obj = Derived()
obj.show()

🗣️ Interview Answer:
Python supports abstract classes using the abc module.
A method is made abstract using @abstractmethod, just like a pure virtual function in C++.
An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly. It only works as a blueprint for derived classes.

✅ 3. Abstract Class Example – Shape Drawing
🔸 Python Code:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def draw(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        print("Rectangle")

class Square(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        print("Square")

# Main
r = Rectangle()
s = Square()
r.draw()
s.draw()

🗣️ Interview Answer:
In Python, abstract classes are used when we want child classes to implement specific methods.
In this example, Shape is abstract, and both Rectangle and Square override the draw() method.


✅ 4. Namespaces in Python
🔹 C++: Uses namespace
🔹 Python: Uses modules, classes, and functions to organize code.
🔸 Python Equivalent Code:
# user-defined namespace using module style
class Add:
    a = 5
    b = 5

    @staticmethod
    def add():
        return Add.a + Add.b

# Main
result = Add.add()
print(result)  # Output: 10

🗣️ Interview Answer:
Python doesn’t have namespace keyword like C++.
But we can create logical code separation using classes, modules (Python files), and packages (folders).
This helps avoid name conflicts — similar to namespaces in C++.

✅ 5. Access Specifiers
🔹 C++: private, public, protected
🔹 Python: Uses naming conventions
| C++         | Python Equivalent            | Meaning                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `public`    | `normal_name`                | Can be accessed from anywhere       |
| `private`   | `__name` (double underscore) | Cannot be accessed directly outside |
| `protected` | `_name` (single underscore)  | Can be accessed in derived classes  |


class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.public = "I am public"
        self._protected = "I am protected"
        self.__private = "I am private"

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.public)         # ✅ allowed
print(obj._protected)     # ⚠️ allowed, but not recommended
print(obj._MyClass__private)  # ✅ allowed using name mangling


🗣️ Interview Answer:
Python does not strictly enforce access control like C++.
But we use naming conventions:

__private for private

_protected for protected

No underscore for public
These are just conventions, not strict rules.

✅ 6. Function and Operator Overloading
🔹 C++: Supports both
🔹 Python:
Function overloading is handled using default args or @singledispatch

Operator overloading is supported using special methods like __add__, __mul__, etc.

🔸 Function Overloading in Python:
python
Copy
Edit
def greet(name=None):
    if name:
        print(f"Hello, {name}")
    else:
        print("Hello")

greet()           # Hello
greet("Abhishek") # Hello, Abhishek

🔸 Operator Overloading in Python:
python
Copy
Edit
class Number:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.value + other.value

a = Number(5)
b = Number(10)
print(a + b)  # Output: 15
🗣️ Interview Answer:
Python supports operator overloading using special methods like __add__, __sub__.
Function overloading isn't directly supported but can be done using default arguments or decorators.

✅ 7. Overloading vs Overriding
| Feature        | Overloading                          | Overriding                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Concept        | Same function name, different params | Same function name in child class |
| Binding Time   | Compile-time (static)                | Run-time (dynamic)                |
| Python Support | Default args or decorators           | Yes, by method overriding         |



🗣️ Interview Line:
Overloading is static binding, done with different parameters.
Overriding is dynamic binding, done when child class redefines the base class method.

✅ 8. Bonus: delete vs delete[] in C++ → Python
🔹 Python Equivalent:
Python uses automatic garbage collection, so we don’t use delete manually.
Python's memory is managed by the interpreter.

✅ Final Interview Tip:
If the interviewer asks you to compare Python with C++, confidently say:

C++ is strict with access and memory, while Python is flexible and dynamic.
Python supports object-oriented programming, but without the need for keywords like friend, virtual, namespace, or manual memory management.
