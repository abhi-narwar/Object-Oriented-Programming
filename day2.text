âœ… 1. Abstraction â€“ Interview Answer in Python:
Answer:
Abstraction in Python means hiding the complex implementation and showing only the important features to the user.
This helps reduce complexity and increases security.

In Python, we achieve abstraction using abstract classes and abstract methods, using the abc module.

Example:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Dog barks")

d = Dog()
d.sound()  # Output: Dog barks

âœ… 2. Data Binding â€“ Interview Answer in Python:
Answer:
Data Binding means connecting the data (backend logic) with the UI so that when the data changes, the UI automatically updates.
While Python does not have built-in UI data binding like Android, we can implement it using frameworks like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy.

Simple Example using logic:

class Person:
    def __init__(self):
        self._name = "Abhishek"

    def set_name(self, name):
        self._name = name
        print(f"UI Updated: Name is now {self._name}")

p = Person()
p.set_name("Rahul")  # Output: UI Updated: Name is now Rahul
ðŸ‘‰ This shows how data (name) is connected to an output (like UI).

âœ… 3. Polymorphism â€“ Interview Answer in Python:
Answer:
Polymorphism means "many forms." It allows the same function or object to behave differently based on the situation.
Python supports both compile-time and runtime polymorphism.

ðŸ”¸ Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading in Python style):
Python doesnâ€™t support method overloading like Java, but we can do it using default arguments or *args.

Example:
class Example:
    def show(self, *args):
        for item in args:
            print(item)

obj = Example()
obj.show(10)          # Output: 10
obj.show("Hello", 5)  # Output: Hello 5

ðŸ”¸ Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding):
In Python, this is done using inheritance and overriding methods in the subclass.
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Animal sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Dog barks")

a = Animal()
d = Dog()

a.sound()  # Output: Animal sound
d.sound()  # Output: Dog barks

# Runtime polymorphism using reference
def make_sound(animal):
    animal.sound()

make_sound(Dog())  # Output: Dog barks

âœ… Final Summary (for combined answer in interview):
"Abstraction hides internal details and shows only essential features,
Data Binding connects logic with UI so that data changes reflect automatically,
and Polymorphism allows one function or object to behave in multiple ways.
These are the important features of Object-Oriented Programming in Python."**
