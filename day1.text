âœ… Interview Answer:
"Object-Oriented Programming, or OOP, is a programming method that is based on the concept of objects and classes. It helps in designing code that is easier to understand, manage, and reuse.

The main concepts of OOP are:

Class:
A class is a blueprint or template to create objects. It contains data members (variables) and member functions (methods). For example, a 'Student' class can have name, ID, and mobile as properties.

Object:
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and can use the properties and methods defined in the class.

Inheritance:
Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. It helps in code reusability. There are different types like single, multilevel, multiple, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance.

Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and methods into a single unit, i.e., the class. It also helps in data hiding, meaning private data can be accessed only through public methods like getters and setters.

These OOP concepts help to make code more structured, reusable, and secure."
